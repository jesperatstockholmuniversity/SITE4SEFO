# SITE4SEFO
SITE4SEFO is a dynamic educational platform for IT security related courses, built as an extension of a platform called DFET - Digital Forensic Evaulation and Training [1]. 

DFET, was a European H2020 project; a collaboration between Stockholm University, Edinburgh Napier Universtity, Jozef Stefan and Stockholm university. The goal of the project was to create an environment for training police and law enforcement in digital forensics. This was done by providing a web based platform, hosting a moodle like course platform where the user could answer qustions and get course material and a virtual machine where they could do the assignments and exericses.  

SITE4SEFO - Simulated Investigation and Training Environment for Security and Forensics
Using the already existing infrastructure from the DFET platform, SITE4SEFO was built from 
by adding support in capacity and competence. SITE4SEFO includes modules for dyanamic case 
creations for exericses and assignments, so that each and every case created by students or 
teachers is tailored for its users. It also includes additional support for network security 
and malware analysis exercises, and is planned to later on incorporate more articial intelligence
for case creation and correction - in game like environment.
