# SITE4SEFO
SITE4SEFO is a dynamic educational platform for IT security related courses, built as an extension of a platform called DFET - Digital Forensic Evaulation and Training [1]. 

DFET, was a European H2020 project; a collaboration between Stockholm University, Edinburgh Napier Universtity, Jozef Stefan and Stockholm university. The goal of the project was to create an environment for training police and law enforcement in digital forensics. This was done by providing a web based platform, hosting a moodle like course platform where the user could answer qustions and get course material and a virtual machine where they could do the assignments and exericses.
